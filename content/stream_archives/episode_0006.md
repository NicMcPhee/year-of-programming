We're *almost* done with the Rustlings exercises (https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings), but I got really bogged down today in one of the conversion exercises. We only completed the first two conversion exercises both of which took a fair while), and then I got completely lost in the third one. We only have 4 exercises left, but it's hard to know how long this will take at this rate. I'll try to do some homework on conversions before Saturday to speed things along.

As well as getting stuck on the fourth conversion exercise, we spent a *lot* of (good, IMHO) time refactoring the second exercise, as well as some time flailing because I had a logical condition flipped and didn't notice it right away. :(

Below are a few time codes, but they're a little less helpful given how long we spent on that one exercise.

0:00 – Introduction and state of play with the Rustlings work
4:50 – Conversions: Using `as`
9:10 – Conversions: `From` and `Into`
1:02:50 – Conversions: `FromStr`
1:25:30 – Conversions: `TryFrom`
2:12:30 – Wrap up

For the moment, at least, I'm streaming every Tuesday and Saturday from 10am-noon CDT (https://twitch.tv/NicMcPhee). We're currently just working through the Rustlings exercises, and I'm hoping we'll finish in the next session. After that I'll probably actually try to build a simple app in Rust to solve a problem that's annoying me. :) See this repo for a description of the problem: https://github.com/NicMcPhee/ice-repos

Thanks for watching!
