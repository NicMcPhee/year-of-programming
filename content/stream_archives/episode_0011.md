Here we worked through the basics of making HTTP calls and parsing the results with `serde`. Got through several examples, but then failed at the last minute when we tried to actually make a request to GitHub. (This is resolved in the next episode.)

For the moment, at least, I'm streaming every Tuesday and Saturday from 10am-noon CDT (https://twitch.tv/NicMcPhee). We're currently working on a simple web app in Rust to solve a problem that's annoying me. :) See this repo for a description of the problem: https://github.com/NicMcPhee/ice-repos

Thanks for watching!
