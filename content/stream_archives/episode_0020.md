A new night! A new topic! New participants!

As an experiment, I'm trying a few additional streaming sessions per week, including Wednesdays from 7-9pm CDT, where I'll work on an evolutionary computation system in Rust. This was the first of those streaming sessions!

I spent a _ton_ of time going over what evolutionary computation is, and skimming over parts of the the existing code. (I've been working on this on and off for a few weeks.) We really only programmed for the last 15-20 minutes, so skip ahead if you don't want all that background.

The main achievement of the session was we parameterized the `next_generation` code so that we pass in a scoring function instead of having that hard coded in several places. Hopefully next week we'll get more actual coding done and I'll babble on less. :)

For the moment (probably through September 2022) I'm streaming four times a week:

* Every Tuesday and Saturday from 10am-noon CDT (https://twitch.tv/NicMcPhee). We're currently working on a simple web app in Rust to solve a problem that's annoying me. :) See this repo for a description of the problem: https://github.com/NicMcPhee/ice-repos

* Wednesday nights from 7-9pm CDT, implementing an evolutionary computation system in Rust to see what the performance is like. https://github.com/NicMcPhee/rust-ga

* Saturday afternoons from 2-4pm CDT, working on some possible lab exercises in Rust for our Systems Practicum course.

Thanks for watching!
