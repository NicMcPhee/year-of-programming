Buckets of flailing. Tried to use the Octocrab library to help manage the GitHub API interactions, but nothing compiled. Turns out that Octocrab doesn't support WASM, nor do any other Rust GitHub API libraries that I looked at. :(

There are also _major_ sound issues for a while in the second hour. Doing full builds clearly ate too much of my computer's resources and the stream audio disappeared as a result. Sorry about that.

For the moment, at least, I'm streaming every Tuesday and Saturday from 10am-noon CDT (https://twitch.tv/NicMcPhee). We're currently working on a simple web app in Rust to solve a problem that's annoying me. :) See this repo for a description of the problem: https://github.com/NicMcPhee/ice-repos

Thanks for watching!
