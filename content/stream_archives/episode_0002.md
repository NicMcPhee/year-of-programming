Here we go through roughly the second quarter of the Rustlings exercises (https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings), going through the exercises on structs, enums, modules, and collections (vectors and hashmaps). Today was definitely slower than Episode 1, partly because I had to look more up (learning! gasp!) and partly because there was a lot of cool interaction with folks on the stream.

I think I improved the video resolution this time, so hopefully the text will be easier to read. I would still probably listen/watch at a higher speed. 1.5x is totally do-able, and even 2x is fine if you're mostly listening and not paying much/any attention to what I'm typing.

Below is a pretty detailed set of time codes. I might recommend jumping to move semantics (50:40) or Quiz 1 right before that (46:20). I'd arguably found my stride somewhat and the discussions there are arguably more interesting than the "getting started" stuff at the beginning.

0:00 - Introduction, including some info on why I'm doing both streaming and coming to better understand Rust
1:24 – Plug for my upcoming Minnebar talk; getting VS Code & Rustlings up
9:00 – Structs (2 exercises)
32:15 - Enums (3 exercises)
57:50 - Modules (3 exercises)
1:23:20 - Collections [Vectors] (2 exercises)
1:36:30 - Collections [HashMaps] (2 exercises). This got long because of some digging around in different ways of handling cases with an conditionally updating a HashMap entry, but I learned a lot doing that, so it was good for me.
2:03:10 - Wrap up

We'll continue the stream (https://twitch.tv/NicMcPhee) next Tuesday (31 May 2022) from 10-noon CDT. By default I'll continue working through the Rustlings exercises for now, but I *might* switch for just that day to working on some code for my Minnebar talk (Saturday, 4 June 2022; https://sessions.minnestar.org/sessions/1307). We'll see.

Thanks for watching!
