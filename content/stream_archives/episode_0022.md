This is the first in a new sub-series of episodes focusing on implementing and building out a set of labs in Rust for our Systems lab course.

We've got a nice set of labs for our Systems lab course, many of which use C or Java. I'd like to see what those labs look like in Rust instead, and possibly write some new labs that introduce the key features of Rust in a somewhat structured way.

As a first simple step on this path, this episode implements a non-threaded echo server in Rust, and then extends it to use threads to handle connections concurrently.

Adding threads took a while because I flailed through figuring out which library(s) to use, and that ate up some time as I wrote and re-wrote code for different libraries. I eventually settled on Tokio for the threading library, and that ended up providing pretty much everything we needed for the project.

The code is actually pretty straightforward and works very nicely, but the error handling is pretty much non-existent at this point, with lots of '?' and at least one `expect` call. I think this be a great opportunity to try one of the nice error handling libraries to try to improve that. That could become one of the major points of a lab, since the code itself is really quite straightforward. I also think we should add proper logging, which would be a natural part of improving the error handling.

There's also no testing at the moment, although we could use variations on the existing `bats` tests to extend that. We might be able to mock some of the Tokio responses, although I'm not sure how complicated that would be.

It's interesting that writing this in Rust actually makes the handling of binary files more straightforward since the "default" Rust read/write tools work with arrays of `u8` as their basic type, so you get proper handling of binary files "out of the box".

The audio on this is pretty annoying, with a *lot* of thumping as I type and click. This is often an issue, but this time it seems much worse than normal. I really out to get a boom for my microphone as I think that would substantially improve the audio. 

For the moment (probably through September 2022) I'm going to be streaming on Twitch (https://twitch.tv/NicMcPhee) every Saturday afternoon from 2-4pm CDT with a focus on these kinds of systems projects.

I'm also streaming on Twitch every Tuesday and Saturday from 10am-noon CDT. We're currently working on a simple web app in Rust to solve a problem that's annoying me. :) See this repo for a description of the problem: https://github.com/NicMcPhee/ice-repos

Lastly, I'm streaming on Twitch on Wednesday nights from 7-9pm CDT working on implementing an evolutionary computation system in Rust, in part to see what the performance is like.

Thanks for watching!
