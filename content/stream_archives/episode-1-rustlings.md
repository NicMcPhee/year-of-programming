In this, my first ever live stream, I went through about the first third of the Rustlings exercises (<https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings>), getting up to the beginning of the exercises on structures.

The quality here is definitely alpha, as advertised. The video resolution isn't quite as high as I'd like, and I'll work to improve that moving forward. I am also suffering from hay fever, so my voice is quite froggy in places, including (unfortunately) right at the beginning. Not an amazing opening, TBH.

I would probably listen/watch at a higher speed. 1.5x is totally do-able, and even 2x is fine if you're mostly listening and not paying much/any attention to what I'm typing.

As mentioned above, this makes it through roughly the first third of the Rustlings exercises. Some of these I just zip through pretty fast, while there are others that I explore some and solve in multiple ways.

Below is a pretty detailed set of time codes, all of which are available as links in the description of the video on YouTube. I might recommend jumping to move semantics (50:40) or Quiz 1 right before that (46:20). I'd arguably found my stride somewhat and the discussions there are arguably more interesting than the "getting started" stuff at the beginning.

* 0:00 - Introduction, including some info on why I'm doing both streaming, and why I wish to better understand Rust
* 2:45 - Setting up Rustlings. There's a false start where I didn't actually follow the install instructions. The proper install process starts at 4:00 and takes a while (had to download and compile a lot of crates).
* 9:50 - Starting up VS Code and running Rustlings for the first time
* 12:10 - Starting `rustlings watch`and the first two Intro exercises
* 16:30 - Variables (6 exercises)
* 30:45 - Functions (5 exercises)
* 40:05 - IFs (2 exercises)
* 46:20 - Quiz 1
* 50:40 - Move Semantics (6 exercises); this is long because I talk a _lot_ about ownership and borrowing. (There's also a phone ringing in the background. I wasn't sure if the mic would pick that up, but it clearly did.)
* 1:31:20 - Primitive types (6 exercises)
* 1:43:20 - Structs (just the first exercise)
* 1:54:00 - Wrap up
