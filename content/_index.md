I'm a computer science faculty at the University of Minnesota Morris, a public
undergraduate liberal arts campus in rural West-central Minnesota. This year I'm
on sabbatical, and I'm using that opportunity to do (& learn) a lot of programming.
I really love programming, and while I _teach_ it a lot in my job, I don't have time
to _do_ so much of it. This year I'm declaring this my **Year of Programming**,
giving myself the chance to _do_ a lot more of it, and reflect on that experience.

A key sub-goal is to learn Rust, as I feel that there's a lot of potential
and enthusiasm there, and it's important to think about what role Rust might play
in our curriculum. I'll definitely be teaching an upper-level elective on Rust next year
(probably Spring, 2024), but I also think there's potential to bring Rust into our
systems core courses in a more focused and intentional way. In many ways I find that
understanding Rust requires a richer understanding of the breadth of computer _science_
than any language I've programmed in in the ~45 years since I first taught myself to
program on a TI-59 programmable calculator.

As a way of holding myself accountable and to engage with (and learn from!) the community,
[I'm streaming several times a week on Twitch](https://twitch.tv/NicMcPhee). See
[my schedule on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/NicMcPhee/schedule) for times and topics.
I'll use [this blog](/blog) to write-up some of the cool things that I learn while I'm streaming.
All the Twitch streams are archived on
[YouTube in a separate "Unhindered by Coding" channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5tGIQti2UYfCSI9aUeSZFQ), 
and I'll be posting some smaller, more focused videos on
[my "main" channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/NicMcPhee) that attempt to capture
specific ideas or concepts.
